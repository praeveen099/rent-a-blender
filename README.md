# rent-a-blender
Project to test my PHP and front-end knowledge. The website will display a list
of blenders that I find where to buy and how much I'd rent them for. Besides that, it
will also allow an ability to contact the administrator of the website to further
to speak about blenders and potentially form a blender society.
